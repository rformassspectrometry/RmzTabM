\arguments{
\item{x}{`data.frame` with rows corresponding to individual *assays* and
columns containing the experimental conditions/study variables. The
number of rows is thus expected to be the same as the number of assays
defined in the *assay* metadata section (using e.g., [mtd_assay()]) and
the order of rows is expected to match the order of assays.}

\item{study_variable_columns}{`character` with the names of the columns in
`x`to be included as study variables. If not defined (the default) a
single study variable will be defined assigning all assays to it.}

\item{average_function}{optional `character` defining the function used to
calculate the study variable quantification value (reported in the
following table(s)). Can be of length 1 or equal to the number of study
variables (to allow defining a different function per variable). Use
`mtd_define_study_variables()` to get the complete set of study
variables for parameters `x` and `study_variable_columns`. Defaults
to the arithmetic mean.}

\item{variation_function}{optional `character` defining the function used to
calculate the study variable quantification variation value (reported in
the following table(s)). Can be of length 1 or equal to the number of
study variables (to allow defining a different function per variable).
Use `mtd_define_study_variables()` to get the complete set of study
variables for parameters `x` and `study_variable_columns`. Defaults
to the coefficient of variation.}

\item{description}{`character` with a textual description of the study
variable. If provided, its length needs to be equal to the number of
study variables. Use `mtd_define_study_variables()` to get the complete
set of study variables for parameters `x` and `study_variable_columns`.
If not provided (the default) the description is used combines the
column name in `x` and the value of the variable.}

\item{factors}{Currently not supported.}
}
\value{
two-column `character` `matrix` with the content for the study
    variables metadata section.

\description{
A *study variable* in the mzTab-M definition is the **value** of an
experimental variable (condition or factor), e.g., `"control"`, or
`"2 hours"` (i.e., it is not the name of the factor). Each study variable
**must** be reported in the following abundance tables. Each assay of a data
set must be referred to from at least one study variable* Even if a data set
has no experimental variables, a study variable **must** be reported,
linking to all assays, with the name `"undefined"`.

Information for the mzTab-M *study variable* metadata section can be created
using the `mtd_study_variables()` function. This function extracts the
relevant information from an input `data.frame` in which rows are expected
to represent *assays* (each row being one assay) and columns the experimental
factors that should be added as study variables.

The `mtd_define_study_variables()` function can be used to get the set
(and order) of study variables that would be generated from an input
`data.frame` depending on the parameter `study_variable_columns`.

\examples{

## Example phenodata/sample data.frame. Each row is supposed to match
## the measurement of one sample (for a certain condition/time point) from
## one individual
x <- data.frame(
    name = c("I1_0", "I2_0", "I1_6", "I2_6", "I3_0"),
    individual = c("I1", "I2", "I1", "I2", "I3"),
    timepoint = c("0h", "6h", "0h", "6h", "0h"),
    T2D = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
)

## Study variables for this data set would be `"timepoint"` and `"T2D"`:
mtd_study_variables(x, study_variable_columns = c("timepoint", "T2D"))

## Specifying a different average and variation function
mtd_study_variables(x,
    study_variable_columns = c("timepoint", "T2D"),
    average_function = "[MS, MS:1002883, median, ]",
    variation_function = "[MS, MS:1002885, standard error, ]")

## Creating a study variable section without defined study variables
mtd_study_variables(x)
