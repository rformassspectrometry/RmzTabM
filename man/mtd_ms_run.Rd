\usage{
mtd_ms_run(
  location = character(),
  instrument_ref = integer(),
  format = character(),
  id_format = character(),
  fragmentation_method = vector("list", length(location)),
  scan_polarity = character(),
  hash = character(),
  hash_method = character()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{`character` with the location (and file name) of the
individual runs. Each element will be one run. This parameter is
required, set to `"null"` if the location of the file(s) is not known.}

\item{instrument_ref}{(optional) `integer()` with the index of the instrument
the run was measured on.}

\item{format}{(optional) `character` defining the format of the external MS
data file. If specified, also `id_format` has be be provided. Can be of
length 1 or equal to `length(location)`. For data file(s) in mzML format,
`format = "[MS, MS:1000584, mzML file, ]"` can be used.}

\item{id_format}{(optional) `character` defining the id format used in the
external data file. If specified, also `format` needs to be defined.
Can be of length 1 or equal to `length(location)`. For data file(s) in
mzML format, `format = "[MS, MS:1000530, mzML unique identifier, ]"`
can be used.}

\item{fragmentation_method}{(optional) `list` of `character` defining the
type(s) of fragmentation(s) used in a given ms run. Length must match
length of `location` if provided. If no fragmentation was used for a
specific file/run use `NULL` for that `list` element (position). As
example, if two runs are included, the first does not have any
fragmentation and for the second CID and HCD was used define
`list(NULL, c("[MS, MS:1000133, CID, ]", "[MS, MS:1000422, HCD, ]"))`.}

\item{scan_polarity}{`character` defining the polarity of a run. Can be
either `"positive"` or `"negative"`. Can be of length 1 or equal to
`length(location)`.}

\item{hash}{(optional) `character` with the hash value of the corresponding
external MS data file. If provided, also `hash_method` needs to be
defined. The length of `hash` has to match the length of `location`.}

\item{hash_method}{(optional) `character` with the hash method used to
generate the value in `hash`. If provided, also `hash` needs to be
defined. The length of `hash_method` has to match the length of `hash`.}
}
\value{
two column `character` `matrix` with the *ms_run* metadata fields
    for a mzTab-M file.
}
\description{
The `mtd_ms_run()` function allows to define and format the *ms_run* fields
of the mzTab-M metadata. The information is build on the actual data file
names along with optional additional parameters to characterize the MS
run(s).

For details and expected input for the various parameter it is **strongly
suggested** to consult the [mzTab-M](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzTab-M/blob/main/specification_documents/mzTab_format_specification_2_1-M.adoc#62-metadata-section) documentation.
}
\note{
At present only a single polarity per run/file is supported.
}
\examples{

## Build a very basic MTD ms_run section for two data files
fls <- c("file:///path/to/file/a.mzML", "file:///path/to/file/b.mzML")
mtd_ms_run(location = fls, scan_polarity = "positive")

## Add also instrument reference information
mtd_ms_run(location = fls, scan_polarity = "positive", instrument_ref = 1)

## Finally, add a fragmentation method used for the second file - no
## fragmentation was used for the first file, thus `NULL` is specified.
## Parameter `fragmentation_method` expects a `list` as input to support
## also multiple fragmentation methods per MS run.
mtd_ms_run(location = fls, scan_polarity = "positive",
    fragmentation_method = list(NULL, "[MS, MS:1000133, CID, ]"))
